<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />

<p>
  M.Swathi is a highly capable Full Stack Developer based in Tiruchirappalli,
  Tamil Nadu, India, with a strong proficiency in both front-end and back-end
  technologies. My core expertise lies in developing high-quality web
  applications using Angular, Java (with Spring Boot), Node.js, and MongoDB.
</p>

<p>
  I possess a balanced skill set, allowing me to contribute effectively across
  the entire development lifecycle. My experience includes leading the backend
  development for a Selenium-based testing accelerator, where I was responsible
  for configuring automated testing modules, efficiently managing data storage
  within MongoDB, and developing robust APIs to facilitate seamless
  communication with the front end.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, I played a pivotal role in the Neuro AI project, where I
  spearheaded the development of front-end features from the ground up using
  Angular. This involved creating dynamic and intuitive user interfaces,
  implementing complex data visualizations to effectively present information,
  and rigorously resolving critical bugs, resulting in significant improvements
  to overall application performance.
</p>

<p>
  Driven by a passion for continuous growth, I am currently expanding my skill
  set to include Python, further enhancing my full-stack capabilities. I am
  committed to staying at the forefront of the ever-evolving technology
  landscape and consistently seek opportunities to learn and apply new
  advancements in my work.
